# Project 1 - **Wordle**

Submitted by: **Haiying Chen**

**Wordle** is an app that is a fun and challenging word-guessing game where you have six tries to guess a five-letter target word. Each guess provides feedback on which letters are correct, in the correct position, or not in the word at all. This app recreates the classic Wordle experience with a clean and interactive UI.

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] App displays a keyboard on the screen
- [x] When tapping on the keyboard, a letter is shown or deleted (letter selected)
- [x] User can play a basic version of Wordle, with different goal words each time

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Improve and customize the user interface by adding a launchscreen and app icon
- [ ] Run the app on a device rather than in the simulator

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
  1. If possible, I want to detect whether the inputed "word" is an actual word, which makes it more similar to the actual Wordle.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
  - Understanding the instructions/following through with them. I found them to be quite vague and often had to ask AI for assistance.
